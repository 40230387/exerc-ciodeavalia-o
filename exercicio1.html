    Hi, I'm Joana!

<p1>
    Dedicated, proactive and focussed on results. And with a touch of perfectionism too.

<p1>
    Graphic designer with 2 years' experience. I've worked with the portuguese shoes brand CASTA, as well as the Fundação Portuguesa do Pulmão and its Foundation and its sub-unit, the Clínica do Pulmão.

    Since my degree in Communication Sciences, I've been working in the Virtual Campus company.

<br>
</br>
<p1>
    I'm constantly learning new concepts in order to keep up and I'm looking for any opportunity to evolve both academically and professionally level. In this way, I'll be able to take my work abroad, which is my ultimate goal.
